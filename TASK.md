# Task Management

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Admin Authentication Implementation
- [x] Add admin authentication middleware to products API
  - [x] POST /api/products - Protected (admin only)
  - [x] PUT /api/products/:id - Protected (admin only)
  - [x] DELETE /api/products/:id - Protected (admin only)
  - [x] GET /api/products - Public (no auth required)

- [x] Add admin authentication middleware to payment endpoints
  - [x] GET /api/xendit/payments - Protected (admin only)
  - [x] GET /api/xendit/payments/orders - Protected (admin only)
  - [x] POST /api/xendit/payments - Public (customer checkout)
  - [x] POST /api/xendit/webhooks/xendit - Public (webhook)

- [x] Create admin API helper utility
  - [x] `/client/src/lib/admin-api.ts` - Centralized admin API calls
  - [x] Automatic token handling and error management

- [x] Update AdminPaymentTable component
  - [x] Use authenticated API calls for payment data
  - [x] Proper error handling for unauthorized access

- [x] Documentation
  - [x] `/ADMIN_AUTH.md` - Complete guide for admin authentication
  - [x] Usage examples and error handling

##### Code Quality Fixes
- [x] Fixed TypeScript type errors in admin components (replaced `any` with proper types)
- [x] Removed unused import in AdminPaymentTable.tsx
- [x] Removed `client/src/lib/admin-api.ts` utility layer
- [x] Updated admin components to use direct fetch calls with authentication headers

##### API Integration Updates
- [x] Updated product fetching endpoints to use n8n webhook URL: `https://n8n-30p2qy5nhmfl.stroberi.sumopod.my.id/webhook/products-get-all`
- [x] Updated product creation endpoint to use n8n webhook URL: `https://n8n-30p2qy5nhmfl.stroberi.sumopod.my.id/webhook/7cc8a841-0d40-44ca-9001-59da26b5bb0c/products-create` (with auth token)
- [x] Update product update endpoint to use n8n webhook: `https://n8n-30p2qy5nhmfl.stroberi.sumopod.my.id/webhook/7cc8a841-0d40-44ca-9001-59da26b5bb0c/products-update/{product_id}` (with auth token, using PUT method, product_id in URL path)
- [x] Updated files: `AdminProductTable.tsx`, `FeaturedCollection.tsx`, `CartPage.tsx`, `ProductDetailPage.tsx`
- [x] Admin delete operations still use local API endpoints for security

### Technical Details

### Authentication Flow
1. Client obtains JWT token via Supabase auth
2. Token included in Authorization header as `Bearer {token}`
3. Server validates token and checks user role in profiles table
4. Only users with `user_role = 'admin'` can access protected endpoints

### Files Modified
- `/server/src/products.ts` - Added admin middleware to CRUD endpoints
- `/server/src/xendit.ts` - Added admin middleware to payment list endpoints
- `/client/src/pages/admin/AdminPaymentTable.tsx` - Updated to use authenticated API calls
- `/client/src/lib/admin-api.ts` - New utility for admin API calls
- `/ADMIN_AUTH.md` - Documentation for admin authentication

### Security Features
- JWT token validation via Supabase
- Role-based access control (admin vs customer)
- Proper HTTP status codes (401, 403)
- Token expiration handling
- No hardcoded credentials or API keys

## Docker Configuration Updates ✅

### Backend Migration to n8n
- [x] Removed server and shared directories from workspace configuration
- [x] Updated package.json to only include client workspace
- [x] Removed workspace dependencies from client/package.json
- [x] Updated TypeScript configuration to work with client-only build

### Docker Build Optimization
- [x] Updated Dockerfile to build client-only application
- [x] Added Nginx configuration for static file serving
- [x] Fixed build dependencies and TypeScript configuration
- [x] Successfully built and pushed Docker image: `hashiif/nusatoys:latest`
- [x] Verified docker-build-push.sh script works correctly with new configuration
